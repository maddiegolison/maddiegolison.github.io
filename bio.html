	<h1 id="header">Maddie's Biography</h1>
	<p>I was born in Southern California where I grew up with my parents, my two younger sisters, and my dogs.</p>
	<p>From the age of four years and old I began swimming competitively.  I was ranked nationally throughout my childhood and qualified for a couple of international competitions while I was in high school.  In high school I competed in the North American Challenge Cup in Canada and the 18th World Maccabiah Games in Israel.</p>
	<p>After I graduated from high school I took a gap year and applied to Tufts University early decision.  During the spring semester of my gap year I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.</p>
	<p>I came back from being abroad and in the Fall of 2012 I began my studies at Tufts University. I am a member of the varsity swim team where I swim the 200 Butterfly and the 400 Individual Medeley.  I study computer science and hope to go into STEM education after graduation.</p>
